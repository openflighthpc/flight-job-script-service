  - id: max_runtime
    text: Expected RUNTIME
    description: >
      Enter the expected runtime for your job.  Specification of a shorter
      runtime will cause the scheduler to be more likely to schedule your job
      sooner, but note that your job **will be terminated if it is still
      executing after the time specified**.
      
      A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  The format
      is one of "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds",
      "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".
      e.g. `3-0` for 3 days.

  - id: memory_limit
    text: Expected hard memory limit
    description: >
      Enter the expected memory usage of your job.  Specification of a smaller
      memory requirement will cause the scheduler to be more likely to
      schedule your job sooner, but note that your job **may be terminated if
      it exceeds the specified allocation**.
      
      Note that this setting is specified in megabytes.  e.g. specify `1024`
      for 1 gigabyte.
