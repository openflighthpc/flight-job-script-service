synopsis: Submit a single job that spans multiple nodes where you want exclusive use of each node allocated. 
description: |
  This may be because you intend to spawn multiple threads yourself or intend
  to run an MPI application. This method is often used for MPI jobs where you
  need to specify the number of processes, machine file and process allocation
  manually, rather than leave this up to the scheduler.
  
  Your job will be allocated the requested number of empty nodes. This method
  should not be used for SMP (OpenMP) jobs. Only use this method if you need
  exclusive use of each node allocated; prefer a multiple slot job for a
  shorter queue time.

  - id: max_runtime
    text: Expected RUNTIME
    description: >
      Enter the expected runtime for your job.  Specification of a shorter
      runtime will cause the scheduler to be more likely to schedule your job
      sooner, but note that your job **will be terminated if it is still
      executing after the time specified**.
      
      A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  The format
      is one of "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds",
      "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".
      e.g. `3-0` for 3 days.
    default: '3-0'

  - id: memory_limit
    text: Expected hard memory limit
    description: >
      Enter the expected memory usage of your job.  Specification of a smaller
      memory requirement will cause the scheduler to be more likely to
      schedule your job sooner, but note that your job **may be terminated if
      it exceeds the specified allocation**.
      
      Note that this setting is specified in megabytes.  e.g. specify `1024`
      for 1 gigabyte.
    default: '1024'
    format:

  - id: number_of_nodes
    text: Processing requirements
    description: >
      Specify the number of processing slots required for your job.

      You should request a processing slot for each simultaneous thread
      (or process) that your script and/or application executes.  Note
      that requesting a larger number of slots will mean that your job
      could take longer to launch.
    default: '2'
