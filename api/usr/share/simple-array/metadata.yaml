  Each job will be allocated a single core on the first available node. Use
  this when you wish to spawn multiple jobs, making use of environment
  variables to differentiate each job. This method should not be used for
  multi-threaded, SMP or MPI jobs.

  - id: max_runtime
    text: Expected RUNTIME
    description: >
      Enter the expected runtime for your job.  Specification of a shorter
      runtime will cause the scheduler to be more likely to schedule your job
      sooner, but note that your job **will be terminated if it is still
      executing after the time specified**.
      
      A time limit of zero requests that no time limit be imposed.  The format
      is one of "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds",
      "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".
      e.g. `3-0` for 3 days.
    default: '3-0'
    format:
      type: text

  - id: memory_limit
    text: Expected hard memory limit
    description: >
      Enter the expected memory usage of your job.  Specification of a smaller
      memory requirement will cause the scheduler to be more likely to
      schedule your job sooner, but note that your job **may be terminated if
      it exceeds the specified allocation**.
      
      Note that this setting is specified in megabytes.  e.g. specify `1024`
      for 1 gigabyte.
    default: '1024'

      type: text

  - id: array_configuration
    text: Array configuration
    description: >
      The array configuration identifies what array index values should be
      used. Multiple values may be specified using a comma separated list
      and/or a range of values with a "-" separator. For example, "0-15" or
      "0,6,16-32".
      
      A step function can also be specified with a suffix containing a colon
      and number. For example, "0-15:4" is equivalent to "0,4,8,12".
      
      A maximum number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array may
      be specified using a "%" separator. For example "0-15%4" will limit the
      number of simultaneously running tasks from this job array to 4.
    default: '1-10%4'
