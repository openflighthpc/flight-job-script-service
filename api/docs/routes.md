# Routes Overview

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

All `DATETIME` fields SHALL use the date-time format described in [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).

## Authentication

All request SHOULD set the `Authorization` using the `Bearer` authentication strategy with there issued `jwt`. Please contact your system administrator to be issued with a token.

Failed authentication requests will return one of two following response unless otherwise stated.

```
# Requests where the Authorization Bearer header isn't set, couldn't be decoded, or the token has expired.
HTTP/2 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "<id>",
      "title": "Unauthorized Error",
      "detail": "Could not authenticate your authorization credentials",
      "status": "401"
    }
  ]
}

# Requsts where the Authorization bearer header was correctly decoded but failed the signature or user check.
HTTP/2 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "<id>",

A [sparse field set](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) can be used to retrieve the `payload` for the `files`. The following example only returns the `payload` attribute, however it can be combined with other `filed` and `include` queries:

```
GET /v0/files/:job_id.:encoded_name?fields[files]=payload
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

HTTP/2 200 OK
{
  "data": {                     # REQUIRED - The FileResource
    "type": "files",            # REQUIRED - Specfies the resource is a file
    "id": STRING,               # REQUIRED - The file's ID (:job_id.:encoded_name)
    "attributes":{
      "payload": STRING         # REQUIRED - The content of the file using UTF-8 encoding
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/v0/files/:id"
    }
  },
  "jsonapi": {
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "included": [
  ]
}
```

## GET - /desktops/:job_id

Return the related `desktop` resource for a `job`.

```
GET /v0/desktops/:job_id
Authorization: basic <base64 username:password>
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "data": {                     # REQUIRED - The DesktopResource
    "type": "desktops",         # REQUIRED - Specfies the resource is a desktop
    "id": STRING,               # REQUIRED - The related job's ID

    }
    "relationships": {

        "links": {
          "related": "/v0/jobs/:id/script"
        }

    }
  },

## POST - /render/:template_id

Renders the template against the provided date and saves it to the filesystem.

There are two formats for the request payload: "Structured" and "Unstructured". The difference between the two is the request payload. The following applies to "Structured" requests. Refer to the end for "Unstructured" format.

NOTE: This route does not conform the JSON:API standard and behaves slightly differently. The authentication/ authorization process is the same however the response body will be empty. The other differences are shown below.

### Structured Requests

Structured requests MUST contain the `answers` key. The `answers` SHOULD be an object containing keys which match the `questions_ids` of the associated `template`. 

The `name` is an OPTIONAL field that sets the identifier for the `script`. It MUST be a unique STRING when provided, otherwise the response SHALL be `409 Conflict`.

The `name` is subject to the following constraints:
* It MUST start with an alphanumeric character,
* It SHOULD be primarily alphanumeric characters but MAY contain hypen and underscore,
* It MUST NOT use any other characters, and
* It SHOULD be less than 16 characters (depending on the underlining CLI tools configuration).

The response SHALL be 422 Unprocessable Entity if the above `name` constraints are not be met.

The `notes` are OPTIONAL but MUST be a string when included. They SHOULD provided additional details about the script.

Due to the underlining templating engine, this route could fail to render for various reasons including but not limited to:
1. The client not sending all the required keys, or
2. The template being misconfigured.

The API may fail to render the script due to a malformed template. The exact behaviour in this situation is undefined.

```
POST /v0/render/:template_id
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "name": STRING,       # OPTIONAL: The name of the script
  "notes": STRING,      # OPTIONAL: Additional details about the script
  "answers": {          # REQUIRED: The answers to the associated questions
    "[key]": "[value]",
    ...
  }
}

HTTP/2 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "data": ScriptResource,
}

# With a duplicate "name"
POST /v0/render/:template_id
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "name": "existing-name"
}

HTTP/2 409 Conflict

# With invalid credentials
POST /v0/render/:template_id
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

HTPP/2 403 Forbidden


# Without credentials
POST /v0/render/:template_id
Accept: application/vnd.api+json

HTTP/2 401 Unauthorized
```

### Unstructured Requests

Unstructured requests provide backwards compatibility with the original API specification. It will not receive future feature enhancements and SHOULD NOT be used.

Unstructured requests MUST NOT contain the `answers` key. All the top level keys SHOULD match `question_ids` of the top level template.

```
POST /v0/render/:template_id
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "[key]": "[value]",
  ...
}

HTTP/2 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
{
  "data": ScriptResource,
}

```
